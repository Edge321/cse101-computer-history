You should describe what topic you chose and
why you chose that topic. Also provide a summary of the
topic, in a general sense. This section should describe any
background information that the reader needs to know to
understand your topic.

\section{TIME PERIOD}

Development of Shrek began in November 1995 after filming rights were
acquired. At the time, Shrek was initially planned to be partially
live-action and computer generated. At this time, Toy Story was just
released. Toy Story was not only the first computer generated film, but
also one of the most successful movies to air, boasting a 100\% approval
rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is often considered one of the best films
ever made. After compiling Shrek, Dreamworks determined the animation style
was insuitable and did not work. They then partnered with the crew behind
the film Antz which was nearing it's theatric release. Upon partnership
the film proceeded to follow the trend of being an entirely computer
generated film and on May 18, 2001 became the 9th computer generated film.

\section{COMPUTER HARDWARE}

Since Shrek was released in 2001, it's safe to say computers that
are considered "ancient" nowadays would have been used for this
movie's production. Even though the movie was released in 2001, production
for computer animation of the movie started in 1996. DreamWorks Animation 
is partners with HP, and used all technology related to HP to make Shrek 
happen. Being partners with HP, it is assumed they used HP Pavilion PCs at
the time of creating the animation of Shrek. The PCs they used looked like
Figure \ref{fig:PC}, and contained the following PC parts in Table \ref{tbl:Parts}.
